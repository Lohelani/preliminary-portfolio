            <p>Hi there! Welcome to my page. My name is Lohelani. I'm a former (and sometimes still) fashion model working on becoming a computer programmer. I'm originally from Hawaii, but was relocated a few times for modeling before becoming signed in New York City, which is what brought me to the east coast. While working full-time as a model is interesting and rewarding, it's a very demanding job, and required me to be on call and ready to go at any time. I've also expanded my repertoire in the fashion industry by working as a modeling agent for an agency back home in Hawaii, but that is just as demanding, if not more so. Since I'm now a single mama to an incredible 2 year old kiddo, I decided to take a step back from my work and continue my education, which was put on hold when I started traveling for modeling, and work towards a more professionally stable life.</p>

            <p>Here on this page you will find a portfolio of coding projects I've worked on or created, which admittedly is quite different from any portfolio I've built before. Additionally, under the contact tab, you can reach out to me regarding these projects, or keep up with me on via various social media platforms. Since I don't currently have anything to show for my work, here's a photo of my chubby baby when she was still a chubby baby. You're welcome. </p>
