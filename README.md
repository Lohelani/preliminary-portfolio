### _By Lohelani Hicks_

## Description and Method

For this project I used bootstrap to create a consistent navbar on all pages.
I added a home tab, portfolio tab, and contact tab, each linked to the appropriate html file and each with a span tag designating the active tab.
All links are functioning in the navbar are functioning. 
Each page is mobile-responsive and deploys the use of culumns and rows, while avoiding the use of media queries.
I included my personal information and personal images on the home page as required, as well as a little bit about me.
Contact page includes personal contact information and has a submit button for sending inquiries, however the submit button.
As a bonus, I included a consistent sticky footer on each page. 
Included links to bootstraps css, and bootstrap javasript in the code.
